# Learning Sinatra

I am a big fan of codeschool (https://www.codeschool.com/) but unfortunately the only ruby web framework they currently cover is Ruby on Rails.

So I have been working through the O'Reilly book "Sinatra Up and Running" which is both concise and fairly comprehensive... there is a nice review at:  http://www.rubyinside.com/sinatra-book-review-5704.html.

This git repository is just the sample code and my runtime notes.
